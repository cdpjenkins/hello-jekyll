Hello Jekyll!

I'm not sure how I feel about playing with Jekyll for the first time in 2025 but hey ho, that's what I'm doing. Mission:
figure out Jekyll, and then probably move cdpjenkins.com onto it, given that Cryogen appears not to be much used or
supported.

Maybe I'll even start "blogging" again. Who knows.
